# AnyConnect Certificate for VPN

To setup your system to use certificate based authentication with
AnyConnect:

1.  Generate a system certificate request and key matching your system's
    FQDN

> **Generating the CSR and key with a hostname of 2yd3hm2**
> 
> openssl req -out 2yd3hm2.csr -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout
> 2yd3hm2.key
> 
> Generating a 2048 bit RSA private key
> 
> ...................................+++
> 
> ......................................................................+++
> 
> writing new private key to '2yd3hm2.key'
>

> You are about to be asked to enter information that will be

> What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or

> 
> There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank

> For some fields there will be a default value,

> If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.

> 
> Email Address \[\]:

> Please enter the following 'extra' attributes

> An optional company name \[\]

2.  Send the CSR file to the Windows team for them to sign it with their
    CA

3.  You will need the signed certificate from Windows, the CA
    certificate, and your private key to setup the AnyConnect client

4.  Rename the signed certificate file to have a .pem extension and the
    key file to have .key

5.  Make $HOME/.cisco

6.  You will need the following directory structure created under
    $HOME/.cisco

> **Directory tree**
> 
> \[16:02:48\]-\[hj1u@2yd3hm2 .cisco\]\~/.cisco $ ls -lR
> 
> .:
> 
> total 0
> 
> drwxrwxr-x. 4 hj1u hj1u 30 Jun 17 10:05 certificates
> 
> ./certificates:
> 
> total 0
> 
> drwxrwxr-x. 2 hj1u hj1u 88 Jun 17 10:11 ca
> 
> drwxrwxr-x. 3 hj1u hj1u 41 Jun 17 10:08 client
> 
> ./certificates/ca:
> 
> total 4
> 
> \-rw-rw-r--. 1 hj1u hj1u 1306 Jun 17 10:07 CACERT.pem
> 
> ./certificates/client:
> 
> total 4
> 
> \-rw-rw-r--. 1 hj1u hj1u 2178 Jun 17 10:08 myclient.pem
> 
> drwxrwxr-x. 2 hj1u hj1u 26 Jun 17 10:08 private
> 
> ./certificates/client/private:
> 
> total 4
> 
> \-rw-rw-r--. 1 hj1u hj1u 1708 Jun 17 10:08 myclient.key

7.  Copy the signed system certificate to
    $HOME/.cisco/certificates/client/myclient.pem

8.  Copy the CA certificate to $HOME/.cisco/certificates/ca/CACERT.pem
    (get the latest AD CA cert from windows eng or pull it yourself)

9.  Copy the private key to
    $HOME/.cisco/certificates/client/private/myclient.key

It is not important that the certificate and key be called "myclient"
but they MUST match and MUST end in .pem and .key.

You are now configured to use certificate authentication with the
AnyConnect VPN client.Â
